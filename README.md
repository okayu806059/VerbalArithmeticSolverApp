<p>"Verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithmetic, cryptarithm or word addition, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. The name can be extended to puzzles that use non-alphabetic symbols instead of letters."(Taken from Wikipediaã€€https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic)</p>
